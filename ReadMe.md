## Usage

The use of this application is to build a basic SVG logo to start your project or have basic placeholder when working on any styling for your porject. After you have run the application through the CLI, you will be prompted with questions about what styling you want your logo to have. For the title, we currently only allow for up to 3 charaters to be typed in as the logo is smaller in size. Feel free to type in any hexadecimal code for you backgroung color and text color as SVG curretnly supports this. Once the prompt has been anwsered. You will see a newly generated SVG file in the Examples directory with your specified styles from the prompt!

This is a super helpful tool as it will show the developer the exact location and expectation of the function that is being test if an error is thrown!
